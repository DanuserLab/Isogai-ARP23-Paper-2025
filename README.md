# Isogai-ARP23-Paper-2025

This repository contains code used in **Direct Arp2/3-vinculin binding is required for pseudopod extension, but only on compliant substrates and in 3D** by Tadamoto Isogai, Kevin M. Dean, Philippe Roudot, Evgenia V. Azarova, Kushal Bhatt, Meghan K. Driscoll, Shaina P. Royer, Nikhil Mittal, Bo-Jui Chang, Sangyoon J. Han, Reto Fiolka and Gaudenz Danuser. Additional information can be found in the methods section of the paper.

Rather than using this repository directly, most users will find it more convenient to download stand-alone software packages with documentation, graphical user interfaces, and additional features from the [Danuser Lab software page](https://github.com/DanuserLab/). However, this repository contains example scripts and small modifications to facilitate batch processing on HPC systems that developers may find useful. Note that while the underlying packages are actively maintained and may be updated, code in this repository is provided as-is. This code was run using Matlab version 2020b.

## Contents

### 2D and 3D PEI Analysis

'2DPEI.m' and '3DPEI.m' are used to analyze 2D or 3D image stacks, respectively. It is currently configured to load .tif files, and to batch process files that are organized in /Cell* in which each 'Cell*' folder contains an independent image file.

### Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA)

Scripts in the `PLA` folder are used to analyze Proximity Ligation Assay experiments. 

- `segment_forPLA.py` can be used to segment cells and is performed using [Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org/), which must be installed separately. It also requires the gradient_watershed to be in the working directory. 
- [u-track](https://github.com/DanuserLab/u-track) need to be used to detect the PLA puncta, saved as a .mat file
- 'DetectPLA_withMask' is used to overlay the detected PLA puncta from the [u-track](https://github.com/DanuserLab/u-track) package on top of the cell masks generated by cellpose. The script then determines the cell area per mask in um2 and calculates the PLA density (#/um2) per mask. The data is stored as a .csv file.
